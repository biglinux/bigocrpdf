# OCR Process Resilience Improvements

## Overview
Made the BigOcrPdf application more resilient when starting OCR processes to address the issue where the application would change to the progress screen but the actual ocrmypdf process wouldn't start.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Process Startup Validation (`services/ocr_api.py`)

**OcrProcess.start() method:**
- Added **retry logic** with up to 3 attempts for process startup
- **Robust startup validation** with increased timeout (3 seconds vs 2 seconds)  
- **Better health checking** that verifies the process is actually working
- **Delayed validation** to catch processes that die shortly after startup
- **Improved error handling** with proper cleanup between retry attempts

**Key changes:**
```python
# Added retry logic with 3 attempts
max_retries = 3
for retry_attempt in range(max_retries):
    # ... process startup logic ...
    
# Enhanced validation that checks progress file creation and content
def _validate_process_startup(self) -> bool:
    # Checks if process is alive, progress file exists, and contains valid data
```

### 2. Improved Progress Monitoring (`services/ocr_api.py`)

**SimpleProgressIndicator class:**
- **Initial progress file creation** to signal process has started
- **Health checking** to detect stalled progress updates
- **More conservative progress updates** (80% over 120 seconds vs 85% over 60 seconds)
- **Better error handling** in progress update loop

**Key changes:**
```python
def start_progress_updates(self):
    # Immediately create progress file to signal startup
    with open(self.progress_file, "w") as f:
        f.write("0.0")
    
def is_healthy(self) -> bool:
    # Check if progress file exists and was updated recently
```

### 3. Enhanced Queue Management (`services/ocr_api.py`)

**OcrQueue._start_new_processes() method:**
- **Delayed process validation** to catch processes that die after startup
- **Better error handling** when processes fail to start
- **Continued processing** of remaining files when one fails
- **Improved logging** for better debugging

**New process health monitoring:**
```python
def _check_process_health(self, process: OcrProcess) -> bool:
    # Monitors process alive status, progress file existence and freshness
    # Returns health status for stall detection
```

### 4. Improved Stall Detection (`window.py`)

**Enhanced progress monitoring:**
- **Increased stall detection thresholds** (45 seconds vs 30 seconds)
- **Better queue status logging** to understand what's happening
- **More attempts before declaring complete stall** (15 vs 10)
- **Additional process validation** when starting

**Key changes:**
```python
# Additional validation after process startup
time.sleep(0.2)  # Give processes a moment to start
with self.ocr_processor.ocr_queue.lock:
    total_processes = len(self.ocr_processor.ocr_queue.queue) + len(self.ocr_processor.ocr_queue.running)
    if total_processes == 0:
        # Fail early if no processes started
```

### 5. Better Error Handling (`services/processor.py`)

**OcrProcessor.process_with_api() method:**  
- **Validation of successfully added files** before starting queue
- **Queue startup verification** with brief delay to check actual startup
- **Better logging** of queue status and process counts
- **Early failure detection** if no processes start

### 6. Enhanced Timeout Management

**Increased timeouts for better reliability:**
- Process startup validation: 2s → 3s
- Stall detection: 30s → 45s  
- Process termination timeout: 10 minutes → 15 minutes
- Progress file staleness check: 10 seconds → 30 seconds

## Benefits

1. **More Reliable Process Startup**: Retry logic ensures transient failures don't prevent processing
2. **Better Error Detection**: Earlier detection of failed processes prevents UI from getting stuck
3. **Improved User Experience**: Clear error messages and automatic recovery
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify issues
5. **Robust Monitoring**: Health checks detect "zombie" processes that appear to run but don't work

## Testing

The improvements can be tested by:
1. Running the application with various PDF files
2. Checking logs for process startup and health monitoring messages
3. Testing with problematic files that might cause startup issues
4. Verifying that retry logic works when processes fail to start

## Files Modified

- `services/ocr_api.py` - Core OCR process management
- `services/processor.py` - OCR processor with validation
- `window.py` - UI progress monitoring and error handling

These improvements should significantly reduce the occurrence of the issue where the progress screen shows but no actual OCR processing occurs.
